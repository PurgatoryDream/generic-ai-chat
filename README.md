# Generic AI Chat Application

Repository made to combine all AI tools I find to simplify testing. I'm also developing a pipeline mode for the chat that allows you to combine different AI models through a frontend that connects the inputs and outputs of each model. The objective would be to simplify the user experience when it comes to creating applications that use AI.

## Usage

- Docker & docker-compose.yml create the environment for the application to run. Once the appropiate container is created, the application should work properly.
- code contains the code of the Flask application.
- The application contains a settings menu so that you can pass your own credentials for the AI models. This is both to simplify user experience and to prevent sharing sensitive information through code in the repository.
